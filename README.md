### Styles

CSS styling uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) framework. The compiled
`static/styles.css` file is included in the repository, but to rebuild it:

1. Install [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) and make sure it is in your PATH (e.g.
   `~/.local/bin` on Linux).
2. Run `pdm run styles`
